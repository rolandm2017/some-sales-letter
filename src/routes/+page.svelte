    <h4 class="underline text-3xl">Critical step #1</h4>
    <p>Be prepared to make cash by posting social media content every day or almost every day.</p>
    <p>
      You must be willing and able to drive traffic to your funnel, or nothing you do on the sales
      page will matter one bit.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 underline text-3xl">Critical step #2</h4>

    <p>Be prepared to adhere to the previous step for many months or possibly years.</p>
    <p>A quality sales page stops working when you stop driving traffic to it.</p>
    <p>
      If your sales page is “good enough” you can keep the same zero-cost funnel running day and
      night for years.

          You might have a great offer that nonetheless <span class="italic">looks</span> doomed to failure

        <p>That is completely fine.</p>

          In fact, most extraordinary performers in your space once looked like generic,
          undifferentiated commodities.

          That is the starting state of most offers that don’t have a genius marketer work on them.

        <h2 class="underline mt-4">Here’s the ingredients of a successful offer:</h2>
        <ol type="1" class="mixed-group">
          <li class="list-decimal ml-12">Your offer needs to be unique in some way.</li>
          <p>
            You might think the way to succeed is to “be the best”... But when every offer out there
            is saying it, it’s really about how you’re different. What can they get from you but no
            one else?
          </p>
          <li class="list-decimal ml-12">
            You need to have proof that it works for someone -- even if it's you.

          <p>
            Every potential buyer and their mom will have the same question: Will this work for me?
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ll show them why those doubts and fears are unfounded in such a way that you yourself
            are certain all your customers can be helped.
          </p>
          <li class="list-decimal ml-12">What makes it scarce or exclusive?</li>

            When you’re below 10,000 Twitter followers, and you’re the only one offering a specific
            piece of advice, your help is, by definition, both.
          </p>
          <li class="list-decimal ml-12">How is it completely risk-free?</li>
          <p>
            People avoid the unsafe and are drawn towards guarantees. This isn’t skydiving or
            entrepreneurship, which attracts risk-takers. Most people are afraid to lose money and
            so we’ll show them how the real risk is missing out on buying.

      <p>But should you do this?</p>

      <p class="font-bold">NO.</p>

      <p>You aren’t trying to be a master copywriter.</p>

      <p>You don’t even want to do it as a hobby.</p>

      <p>(If you did, you wouldn’t have read this far.)</p>

      <p>
        You could also get a job as a sales rep (like I did), and spend 12 months selling via the
        phone or in person. This would help you go the extra mile to prepare for selling online.
      </p>

      <p>But should you do this?</p>

      <p class="font-bold">NO.</p>

      <p>
        You aren’t trying to master selling 1 on 1. Although The Wall St Playboys recommend
        learning, and it is a great idea, you don’t need to do that.
      </p>

      <p>Here’s what else you could do to prepare for writing a sales letter:</p>

      <p>
        Expert copywriter Joshua Lisec, and many others, use hypnotism to up the oomph in their
        sales letters.
      </p>

      <p>You could take an 8 week course in the subject (like I did).</p>

      <p>
        You could learn to weave in sensory details into your copy: What the buyer will feel, smell,
        taste, see and hear after they buy.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could learn to use your prospect’s current beliefs about the world and your offer. This
        would enable you to present your offer in the best light.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could learn to “pace” them, meaning match the beginning of the letter with their
        existing perceptions, to establish trust.
      </p>

      <p>But should you?</p>

      <p>No, you don’t need to do all that (and to be blunt, it’s complicated).</p>

      <p>You can skip the whole thing.</p>

        <span class="underline">Difference #1</span>: Other copywriters want you to be ready to

        <span class="underline">Difference #2</span>: Other copywriters want your offer to already
        be moving $5,000/month. (Because otherwise they aren’t sure they can sell it).

      <p>
        Cicada is cool with your offer being green and untested, because the type of person who
        reads all that text is also game to follow the process. (And he’s sure he can sell it.)

      You will learn more about your customers, which means your intuition about what they want to
      buy will improve.

    <p>
      As part of the process, we’ll have 1 on 1s with people who have bought from you or are already
      using your free content.
    </p>

    <p>
      That means you’ll find out what your target market really wants. If your beliefs about them
      are incomplete, you’ll fill in the gaps. If you’re completely wrong about how they want to use
      your offer, you’ll find out!
    </p>

    <p>You will see different ways to think about your offers.</p>

    <p>
      What is obvious to me might not be obvious to you, and vice versa. By taking advantage of this
      offer, you’ll receive an in depth look at how you could position your offer.

    <p>
      I expect the sales page I give you to convert, and will say no to anyone whose page I don’t
      think I can beat. However, supposing the page I give you performs worse, you’ll receive a full
      retrospective about what I think I got wrong.

      These are all guaranteed upsides to happen as a result of participating. You won’t lose

        You’ll receive an aesthetic, psychology-laden sales page. It will convert and you’ll go from

        Blackhatwizard correctly states that doing work for free in the beginning is a good

        <li>I’ll only be doing this for a few months at most.</li>

      <p>
        You can tell I am great at writing and highly creative. Having practiced sales in one form
        or another for half a decade, you can be certain this offer will cost money in the near
        future.

      <p>In the meantime, you can get a sales letter written for your product for free.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-4">“But what do you get out of doing it for free?”</h2>
      <p>
        90% of people who receive this free help will do something to pay me back. Indeed helping
        people out without asking anything in return is a great reward.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you sense you will be among the 90%, you are welcome to proceed. If you are among the 10%
        who has no intention of paying me back, you are also welcome to proceed!

      <p>Inventing an idea that will sell is hard.</p>

      <p>Committing to pursuing an idea is hard.</p>

      <p class="italic">Seeing it flop is hardest of all.</p>

      <p>So while I will bust my ass writing to help you, you are asked to repay the favor by:</p>

      <ol type="1" class="mixed-group">
        <li class="ml-12 list-decimal">
          Writing a testimonial describing how the sales letter changed your WiFi money business.
        </li>

        <p>You can help me out big time by describing:</p>

        <ul class="ml-12">
          <li class="list-disc">Where you were before you found me</li>
          <li class="list-disc">What stopped you from selling without me</li>
          <li class="list-disc">What it was like to have someone handle selling for you</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And then…</p>

        <ul class="ml-12">
          <li class="list-disc">How far you made it in 1-2 months using the sales page</li>
          <li class="list-disc">What it was like to have the sales</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The other thing you can provide is:</p>

        <li class="ml-12 list-decimal">
          Sales data from previous traffic (e.g. through Gumroad). Please provide copious
          before/after screenshots, identifying info removed.
        </li>

        <p>My goal is to prove what I already know:</p>

        <p class="italic">That my sales letters sell and sell well.</p>

        <p>That is the second half of the transaction.</p>

        <p>So yes, it does cost some time and energy to participate.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 underline font-bold text-center pr-8">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “What if I don’t have a product or service ready to sell?”</h3>

    <p>
      A: You are welcome to message me for free brainstorming about what you could sell, what you
      could offer. So long as you commit to posting the page until it gets to 10,000 views, you are
      welcome to tell me “I only have an idea.” We can do a pre-sale, or in other words, “Sell it
      before you build it.”
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “Why is it free?”</h3>

    <p>
      A: Some people like to sell their service before they’ve lifted a finger to confirm they can
      perform. I am the opposite. Your results will go with me as case studies to my first paid
      clients.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “This won’t work for me.”</h3>

    <p>
      A: Without knowing exactly why you say that, you can be sure that as long as you put the sales
      page in front of 10,000 people, you will make 100 sales. That is a 1% conversion rate and is
      achievable.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
      Q: “What if I can’t or won’t put in 10-20 hours to help research the market?”
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you want to speedrun your part of the bargain, you can complete the entire onboarding
      process in three hours. All you have to do is indicate to in clear language that:
    </p>

    <ol type="a" class="ml-12">
      <li class="list-decimal">
        You understand that your sales would perform better with research.
      </li>
      <li class="list-decimal">You commit to posting the page until it gets 10,000 views.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you confirm that you’d prefer “Low inputs + decent payoff” to “high inputs + great payoff,”
      I’m happy to bang out a sales page in 48 hours with little research.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I recommend you don’t make a habit of it. <span class="font-bold"
        >The version made with 20 hours of research put into it will sell better and net you
        hundreds of more sales across a twelve month timeframe.</span

          If you’re already making sales online, you know that the notification of a transaction is
          a rush like no other.

          Either way, you know you want to sell so often that the rush goes away, and you’re just…

        <p class="">At which point a sale is a notification like any other.</p>

        <p class="">But so far, the notifications don’t bore you yet.</p>

        <p>
          Because you are at the point where a 5 figure price tag on a sales funnel that might not
          work is too risky.
